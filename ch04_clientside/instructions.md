# Instructions for Chapter 4 Lab

### Part 0 (setup)

1. Open `PyCharm` and open the `software101` project, if it's not
   already open.

2. Right-click on `software101` and choose _Git \> Repository \>
   Pull..._ and click **OK** to pull down and merge anything that
   might've changed from the original GitHub repository.

### Part 1 (demonstration of the browser's developer tools)

1. Load the `Firefox` browser and navigate to the NIST web site (the
   same one as the previous lab exercise,
   <https://www.nist.gov/topics/cybersecurity>)

2. Open the browser's _DevTools_ by selecting _Tools → Web Developer →
   Toggle Tools_

3. Click the browser's `Reload` button that appears in the content of
   the `Network` tab.

4. Answer these questions about the results: 

    1. How many HTML documents are there?

    2. How many CSS documents?

    3. Which component of the page took the longest to load?

    4. Were any of the requests loaded in parallel to the others?  How can you tell?

5. A later lab will demonstrate using the _DevTools_ to look at actual
   web content, like XML and/or JSON data as it flows from client to
   server and back again.
