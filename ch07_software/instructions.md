typing `cd software101` and pressing _Enter_ at the command prompt.
Execute `git pull` to pull any updates to the GitHub repository
down to your virtual machine.

### Lab Ideas?

I'm looking for things that might be relevant for this lab.

We've already covered many of the Python modules, but we could do a walk
through that demonstrates how the modules are used by the application.

I also considered an example of running the Flask server inside a
container, then perhaps running another container that connects to the
first one.  But I expect the students in this course are already
familiar with containers, so I didn't think this would be particularly
informative.

So for now, we'll just take a quick break while we discuss options,
and then move on to the next chapter.
