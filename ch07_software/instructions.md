# Instructions for Chapter 7 Lab

### Part 0 (setup)

1. Open `PyCharm` and open the `software101` project, if it's not
   already open.

2. Right-click on `software101` and choose _Git \> Repository \>
   Pull..._ and click **OK** to pull down and merge anything that
   might've changed from the original GitHub repository.

### Part 1 (bringing it all home!)

1. This lab will tie together many of the pieces from previous chapters.

2. It will demonstrate code that reads and writes XML data to a file,
   and another one that does the same with JSON.
   
3. Those application will morph into server-side applications that
   return data in XML and/or JSON in response to a browser request. it
   will use `Connexion` to declaratively configure the RESTful
   endpoints.
   
4. `Postman` will be used to interactively explore the JSON API provided
   by the server side application.
